I have made Alexa skills that can access to Oras and also different datasources to get information about consumption.
What I did is voice command application for getting household information. User can ask simple questions about example. water consumption. 

Easy way to access consumption data from just ask data. No need to get extra monitors or applications to view consumption usage.
